/// The local fork is a list of messages that have been executed locally
/// but have not yet finished their roundtrip through the server.
/// Typically, people avoid drawing over each other, so most messages from different
/// users arriving at the same-ish time are *concurrent* with the locally executed messages.
/// When this is not the case, the conflict is detected by the local fork and the canvas
/// must be rolled back.
///
/// If the user is not drawing at the moment, the local fork can be discarded at this point,
/// since there are probably more conflicts on the way. However, if the user is still actively
/// drawing, it's better to just move the local fork to the end of the history, because otherwise
/// we'll get into a self-conflict loop as our own messages trickle back.
///
/// Whether the user is drawing or not at the moment is detected by the DrawDab* and PenUp
/// messages.
///
/// Most messages are self-contained and their area of effect is easy to determine. However,
/// when drawing in indirect mode, things get a bit more difficult. In indirect mode,
/// the brush dabs are first drawn on a temporary sublayer, so they are always concurrent.
/// Only when the finished drawing is merged onto the main layer (on PenUp) is there possibility for
/// conflict. When determining the affected area for an indirect dab, the dab bounds are remembered
/// in the `indirect_area` buffer. On PenUp, this buffer will be returned. There is room for improvement here,
/// since the axis aligned bounding rectangle can be excessively large for some indirect strokes. (E.g.
